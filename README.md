# min-char-rnn

This is a fork of [Andrej Karpathy's short gist](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086) which implements a minimal character-level recurrent neural network (RNN).

To try to understand the code better, I've made the following changes:

- fixed for Python 3
- reorganized the code using classes
- added type hints
- renamed some variables for clarity
- added `STARTING_TEXT` string instead of just starting with one character
- added constants at the top for easy modification (see below)


Since it isn't a complete command-line utility (not the goal here), there are several constants you can modify at the top of the code:

- `INPUT_FILE`: the text it's using as its source
- `STARTING_TEXT`: the text to start off with
- `SAMPLE_SIZE`: how many characters to output
- `SAMPLE_OUTPUT_FREQ`: output some sample text after this many iterations
- `HIDDEN_SIZE`: size of hidden layer of neurons
- `SEQUENCE_LENGTH`: number of steps to unroll the RNN for
- `LEARNING_RATE`: the learning rate

The data directory contains some public domain text to try including Hans Christian Andersen, Shakespeare (large and small), and Sherlock Holmes. Change `INPUT_FILE` to point at one of these (and maybe modify the `STARTING_TEXT` to make more sense contextually)

To run it:
```sh
python3 min-char-rnn.py
```

This will continue to output text until you stop it with <kbd>Control</kbd>-<kbd>C</kbd>.

Example:
```
% python3 min-char-rnn.py
input data has 4573338 characters (67 unique)

So far it hsan't produced anything entirely in English for me... ðŸ˜€
